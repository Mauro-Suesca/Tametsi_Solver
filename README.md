# Tametsi Solver

Tametsi is a minesweeper based puzzle game in which every level is solvable by using only logic, no luck required.
This project's purpose is to discover and implement an algorithm capable of solving some of the levels of this game (namely the ones that have rectangular shapes only, as it is difficult to show the other ones in a CLI).
